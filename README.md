# classification-modeling
<br>
The classification-modeling project was created as a part of a Machine Learning course in a master's program in Data Science at TU Wien. <br>
The goal was to experiment with different combinations and settings, and go through the whole machine learning process from getting the data, preparing it, making the predictions, to evaluating and comparing the results, discussing them and drawing final conclusions.

More about the experiment design, methods, techniques, considerations and justifications of steps can be found in Assignment 1.pdf.
